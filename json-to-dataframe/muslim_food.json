From the food to the dining experience and even the customer service.\n\nI made a trip here again in October 2021 and the service fell short of my expectation. For starters, you will have to choose what you wish to order before you enter their restaurant and they will take forever to serve you one of the dishes that you have ordered. That's fine, I guess there must have been a slight mix-up or the chef overlooked on our order since every other dish arrived on time.\n\nToday, I paid a visit there and the service was appalling. For someone who placed a reservation at 2 and arrived there on time, we were only served with our food at 2:40pm. The tom yum soup that we ordered was cold by the time the waiter served us our dishes and the bell that's on the table to ring the waiter to enquire about your order? Don't bother pressing that because no one will approach you, especially when you are seated on the second floor. I came here, hoping my friend would be impressed with the food, ambience, and the service, but safe to say, she wasn't the least impressed after our meal.\n\nWhen it's time to pay at the counter, even the person at the counter would take 10-15 minutes to serve you (even when there's no queue). I am extremely disappointed with the service rendered by the wait staff and definitely won't be returning again.\n\nThe two stars are only for the cost of the dishes we both ordered. Nothing else.","rating":2,"authorName":"Anna","authorURL":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105946484472503032534/reviews","profilePhoto":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjZl7lvW8is4Xf89cL_pVrnlcN1KbUD4075WpTr8w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","time":"2021-12-09T14:11:43Z","language":"en"},{"text":"Best Thai food.

Totally regretted my decision this morming. I was served by a rude staff (tall, male, with a scrawny beard) who told me off for my queries. I had asked about the price of the lamb shank (its $25 or thereabouts) and if they sell mutton korma.\nHe gave me a condescending look and said korma is same as curry. And when I asked if they had murtabak ready to go (coz I saw them making a bunch at the back) he let go a tirade of verbal abuse and accused me of being able to buy from Islamic Restaurant which is more expensive but had so many questions at his shop (I asked 3 questions to help me make a decision on what to buy). I was shocked and was speechless for a second. I then regained my composure and replied that it's my first time and there was no price list so I had to make enquiries. I was buying the briyani fr Islamic for some one and I didn't have to explain to him anything. I admonished him for being so rude towards me and for his insulting remarks and said that he has lost a customer. He said ok. I then turned to his colleague and informed him that this guy is so rude to me and its intolerable and he just looked helpless, speechless and shook his head.\n\nLooks to me that it's a normal occurrence there looking at the negative reviews on customer service or lack of. I would give it a -ve review if the feature is available. Disgusting. Uncalled for rudeness. Ruined my day.  I am fuming. Avoid at all cost unless you thrive of rude service and insults.\n\nDespite that, as the teh tarik was already made and I do not want to waste food, I paid  for it ($1.20) and walked away after telling this chap to just chill. He may be having a bad day but he has NO RIGHT to dump it on anyone else.\n\nI won't be giving this shop anymore of my hard earned money.

Avoid this place. I ordered 1 plain prata and 1 egg prata that costs me $7. They didnt prompt me that it doesnt come with the curry so they just ask me to choose mutton or chicken curry, only to find out that I have to pay $4 for the curry. Really such dishonest business.
