I was buying the briyani fr Islamic for some one and I didn't have to explain to him anything.

That is when they started to act hostile and rude towards us. We could clearly see the frown. We ordered the Mexican lasagna and Hawaiian pizza. The lasagna tasted a little stale and rubbery. I felt this occurred because it was a little under cooked. We had to wait for a really long time to get our pizza. We sat there waiting for 45 minutes straight. One of the waiters almost cleared our plates. It was embarrassing. The pizza was very cheesy and did not have any unique flavour. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza, and they only sprinkled a little of bell peppers and pineapple on the top.\nThe hygiene is also awful.
