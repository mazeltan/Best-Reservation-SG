Why have a ‚Äúprivate room‚Äù when there was just a wooden partition with holes in between?! Why sit a couple near to a table of loud uncles where there were so obviously other seats available in the restaurant?\n\nAnd the problem is - we did reserve beforehand so not sure why we were subjected to such a disturbing experience.

But the other menu items are dubious.\n\nThe miso soup is a ‚Äúfusion‚Äù miso soup that tastes more like Tonjiru Soup. On top of that, there are diced tomatoes inside. Tomatoes are used in western cuisine for Umami flavor but why use that when there are countless japanese ingredients that can provide that.\n\nThe Wagyu beef sushi roll was completely covered in sesame seeds, which masked the flavor of everything else inside. To top it off, when the roll was deconstructed I found kimchi inside. There was also arugula and cucumber which all come together weirdly. This roll seemed like a random mix of ingredients none of which paired each other.\n\nThe Miso Cod was another hit and miss. The miso glaze was well done but the chef decided to add parmesan cheese which was a strange combination and the result was a piece of Cod with melted cheese on top.\n\nThe menu also only included one pork item which the restaurant had sold out of. The chawanmushi was also sold out.\n\nOverall definitely if you are only looking for raw fish.
